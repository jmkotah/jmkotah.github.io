<p>I am a Filipino neuroscientist currently based in the Netherlands. My PhD work at the <a href="https://akorosi.wixsite.com/korosigroup">Aniko Korosi</a> and <a href="https://sils.uva.nl/content/research-groups/structural-and-functional-plasticity-of-the-nervous-system/structural-and-functional-plasticity-of-the-nervous-system.html">Paul Lucassen</a> lab at the University of Amsterdam involved using mouse models to study long term consequences of early-life stress exposure in the context of aging, inflammation, and amyloid-Î² neuropathology. My current postdoc with prof. dr. <a href="https://bscs.umcg.nl/nl/people/bart-eggen/">Bart Eggen</a> and dr. <a href="https://bscs.umcg.nl/en/people/susanne-kooistra/">Susanne Kooistra</a> involves studying microglia in the context of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>My training includes a bachelors degree in psychology from the <a href="https://www.psych.upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines Diliman</a>, and two joint masters degrees as part of the <a href="https://www.neurasmus.u-bordeaux.fr/">Neurasmus</a> program. I have experience in a variety of wet lab (e.g., behavioral neuroscience and molecular neurobiology) and dry lab (e.g., single cell and spatial transcriptomic) techniques, and hope to use these skills to contribute to building neuroscience in the Philippines.</p>
