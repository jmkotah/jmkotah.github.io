<p>I am a Filipino neuroscientist currently based in the Netherlands. My PhD work with the <a href="https://akorosi.wixsite.com/korosigroup">Aniko Korosi</a> and <a href="https://sils.uva.nl/content/research-groups/structural-and-functional-plasticity-of-the-nervous-system/structural-and-functional-plasticity-of-the-nervous-system.html">Paul Lucassen</a> lab at the University of Amsterdam involved the use of mouse models to study long term consequences of early-life stress exposure on later-life challanges, such as aging, inflammation, and amyloid-Î² neuropathology. I am currently a postdoc in the lab of prof. dr. <a href="https://bscs.umcg.nl/nl/people/bart-eggen/">Bart Eggen</a>, studying microglial profiles in the context of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.</p>

<p>While my bachelors degree was in psychology, during my masters in the <a href="https://www.neurasmus.u-bordeaux.fr/">Neurasmus</a> program, I was able to acquire a more neurobiological background. During my PhD, I was able to supplement this with a variety of wet lab experiments involving behavioral neuroscience and molecular neurobiology. Currently, I am doing a more bioinformatics-focused postdoc, as I use single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to study the human brain.</p>

<p> My hope is to someday use this combination of wet and dry lab skills to contribute to building neuroscience in the Philippines.</p>
