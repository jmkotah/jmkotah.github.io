We have a new publication out in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08518-6">Communications Biology</a>. This project was borne from our attempts to design better ways to analyze our pilot in situ sequencing data, and involves allocating transcripts based on immunostaining masks. We hope to use this framework to then obtain biological insights in future studies.
