I am very happy to have received an Early Career Grant from <a href="https://www.alzheimer-nederland.nl/">Alzheimer Nederland</a> to conduct a 2-year research project investigating shared neuroimmmune signatures in Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia. This project will be done with the single cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis pipelines we have set up in the group.
